# Database Enums

The Enums in this directory contain IDs used by the seeders when creating database records. The IDs in these enums relate to the ID on a specific database record.

It is important that for database records which are defined by the development team (Cannot be updated/created/changed via UI or API), that the IDs used are defined in the application via enums.
